# Batch Context

The Batch Context extension for EEGLAB provides an interface for generating data 
processing pipelines and executing them on multiple data files either locally or 
on remote clusters. This extension also provides the tools needed to manage 
remote server addresses and facilitates working in remote environments.

All documentation is stored on the [Wiki](https://github.com/BUCANL/Batch-Context/wiki) which contains relevant video tutorials.
